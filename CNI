CNI: Is a set of standards that define how programs should be developed to solve the networking challenges in a container runtime environment. These programs are called plugins.
Some 3rd party plugins are celium calico weave.
These container runtimes implements CNI standards.  

Kube-api server listens on 6443
Kubelet 10250
Kube-schedular 10259
Kube-controller-manager 10257
Worker nodes expose services 30000-32767
ETCD 2379
If multiple masters, then alongwith above., etcd on both at 2380 i.e peer to peer connectivity bw control nodes

Commands related to n/w in a node
ip addr
ip route
netstat --help

Pod networking
Networking at  the pod level
A cluster will soon have pods and services running on it. how these pods are going to communicate with each other
How do you access the services running on the pods within the cluster or externally from theoutside of the cluster
So as of today K8s does not come with a built in solution fo this.
Many nw solutions available that does this. Celium calico
